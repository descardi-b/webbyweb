        <p>We're here to do one thing and one thing only: shoot some Nazis.
        <br /><br />
        When NASA interns Reggie Nielson and Elisa Yang discover that the godfather of modern American rocketry was a former Nazi, the unlikely pair decide to take matters into their own hands in the only way they know how: 
        time travel back to 1969 and kill the motherfucker. A multiverse revenge tale, <b>LASTHUNTER</b> investigates the evolution of authoritarian thought, the limitations of individualism, and the malleability of morality when living 
        within the bounds of a well-oiled system.
        <br /><br />
        On their journey, Reggie and Elisa encounter real and imagined figureheads of Nazi hunter history, with each showing them the ropes in hope that they might become the last of their kind -- in other words: 
        <br /><br />
        The Last Hunters.
