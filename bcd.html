        <p>Assimilation fucking sucks. Add being a girl on top of that, and you're playing life on hard mode. 
        <br /><br />
        Welcome to the world of <b>BAD CHINESE DAUGHTER</b>, a sweeping epic based on every time any Chinese girl's 婆婆 has yelled at her for her poor life choices. 
        Follow three generations of Wang women as they navigate life, loss, and love in America all while trying to salvage the gifts of their past. 
        With each new daughter deciding the future of the next in their hands, <b>BAD CHINESE DAUGHTER</b> investigates how we are (happily and unhappily) tethered to those who came before us, 
        and how we are (luckily and unluckily) empowered, enraged, and entrapped by tradition. Most of all, these women ask:
        <br /><br />
        What does it mean to be good?
